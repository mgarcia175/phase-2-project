# Movie-Verse
The interactive movie application, designed to give you more power over you movie-watching experience.

## Description

Movie-verse is a fun application, which allows users to really dive into the universe of movies by giving them the control to explore, learn and plan their jounrey to watch movies which they are interested in!

From looking up specific movies, to being able to save them with their own watch list, users are also able to write their own reviews on the movies they have watched, Movie-Verse is designed to give more power and guidance to movie enjoyers, from beginners to experienced.

Let's run throught the nifty features available, when using Movie-verse, and how the application works!

The application starts with 3 pages that are able to be visited:

1. The Search Movies page 
1. The My Review page
1. The Watch List page

The first route, being the Search page and the starting page, brings you to a search bar. This where you are able to bring up any movie you can think of with a quick and easy search. This is a great way to not only be able to play around with all the types of movies there are, but allow you to specifically search out a movie you have been wanting to see, for further details on it.

Once the desired movie has been generated, you will be able to see the movie generated within it's very own card that contains 2 buttons, which fire off some more cool functionalities!

One of those functionalities, is the "Thumbs up!" feature. This allows you to give a movie your approval by being able to add the fact that you have watched it, and liked it. The other is the "Add to your Watch List" button, which adds the selected movie to your Watch List, which brings us to the next page.

The Watch List page is where you will see all the movies you are planning on watching in the future! You may add as many as you like.

While on this page, you will notice that the movie poster have two buttons. The first, being a green check mark, allows you to remove the selected movie once you have watched it. This way you are able to keep your Watch List updated with the movies you have yet to see. The second button, being a pencil, allows you to write a review for that movie! Yup, go ahead and let everyone know what you liked, didnt like, or your overall thoughts. This brings us to our final page.

The My Reviews page will hold all of the reviews you have written, along with the title of the movie as well.

Happy movie hunting!

The application is set to the Movie Search page by default, but simply clicking on the option.

Once clicked, or the application is loaded, you will be presented with a search bar. Type any movie you want to watch, have watched, or even any starting letter just to have some fun!

Here, I have searched for Shrek. Notice everything matching will appear, so typing the first portion of the movie will bring up all of the options! This is why Not only do all of the Shrek movies appear, but even the musical, ***or*** even movies you wouldn't have guessed existed! This is great for discovering similar movies from ones you have already watched!
